= NMEA2000 library for C++ =

Object oriented NMEA2000 library for Teensy, Arduino, MBED and Rasberry type Boards.
These board types has been tested, but library may work also in other systems.

Library gives you easy way to make different kind of NMEA2000 bus devices like
NMEA2000->PC interface (like Actisense NGT1), NMEA0183->NMEA2000 converter,
sensor (e.g. temperature, wind, engine) node.

Library fulfills NMEA 2000 mandatory functions and behaviour, so it
looks a bit complex inside. With default settings it requires about 23 kB rom
and 3.3kB RAM in normal operation. So I prefer to use Teensy 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 4.0, 4.1 or
ESP32 board. Arduino Due board works fine, but is physically bigger and eats
more power. Arduino Mega board is ok for simple projects.
Arduino Uno board has too little memory for full
functionality. See "Memory requirements" later.

If you are not sure what board would be best, I personally prefer Teensy boards. They are
smaller size, more powerfull and uses less power than traditional Arduino Mega or Due boards. Also 
Arduino Mega double is only 4 byte, while some NMEA2000 data uses 8 byte which means that with Mega you will
loose accuracy.

To use Teensy 4.0/4.1 boards internal CAN you need also 
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_Teensyx[NMEA2000_Teensyx] library. CAN library
is included to the code so you do not need any extra CAN library with this. NMEA2000_Teensyx
library will replace NMEA2000_teensy library in future. You can already start to use it with
all Teensy boards by forcing it with define (see NMEA2000_CAN.h comment). For critical
projects I prefer to use old library until this has been running under tests for a while.
 
To use a Teensy 3.1/3.2 or 3.5/3.6 board internal CAN with a MCP2562 or MCP2551
CAN-bus transeiver (or similar, see FlexCAN documentation), you will need the
https://github.com/sarfata/NMEA2000_teensy[NMEA2000_teensy] library contributed
by (https://twitter.com/sarfata/[Thomas Sarlandie]) and the
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/FlexCAN_Library[FlexCAN library]. FlexCan
library is already included in
https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html[Teensyduino] extension. In order
to use my fork, you have to remove FlexCAN library from `C:\Program Files
(x86)\Arduino\hardware\teensy\avr\libraries\FlexCAN`

To use ESP32 boards you need also https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_esp32[NMEA2000_esp32] library. ESP32
CAN driver by Thomas Barth has been implemented inside NMEA2000_esp32
so you do not need other drivers for that.

To use Arduino Due board internal CAN you will also need 
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_due[NMEA2000_due] library
and due_can library, which you can download from
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/due_can

To use Arduino boards with MCP2515 CAN bus controller, you will also need
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_mcp[NMEA2000_mcp] library and mcp_can library. Use mcp_can library found on
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/CAN_BUS_Shield, which is developed version of
original mcp_can library. This allows also to use 8MHz clock and has been tested with
Maple Mini.  mcp_can library can be originally found on
https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield, but check library status has all improvements
been implemented to Seeed-Studio. At least 18.09.2017 it was up to date. 

To use avr processors internal CAN you need also 
https://github.com/thomasonw/NMEA2000_avr[NMEA2000_avr] library and
avr_can library, which you can download from
https://github.com/thomasonw/avr_can

To use MBED boards you need also 
https://github.com/thomasonw/NMEA2000_mbed[NMEA2000_mbed] library and other related
libraries. See origin for MBED port on
https://github.com/thomasonw/NMEA2000_mbed

To use Raspberry boards you need also 
https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_socketCAN[NMEA2000_socketCAN] library.
NMEA2000_socketCAN has been originally forked from
https://github.com/thomasonw/NMEA2000_socketCAN

== Thanks ==

I thank Kees Verruijt for his excellent CanBoat project and Dr Andrew Mason for
OpenSkipper project.  I originally started to learn NMEA 2000 via OpenSkipper
project, which development I continued.  PGN library on OpenSkipper and so on
this library is mostly based on Kees work. Also it appeared that some code
parts are probably originally from CanBoat even I have found them from other
sources.  Actisense message format handling I have learned from OpenSkipper
project.

I also thank for anybody who has extended library with new PGNs or processor
support.

  known messages, one should have provided list with SetFastPacketMessages.

27.06.2020

- Fixed PGN 130314 and PGN 130315 pressure type to signed.

- Added pressure enums.

28.01.2019

02.12.2017

- Changes effect only use of tN2kDeviceList and AttachMsgHandler callbacks.

- Added FindDeviceByIDs to tN2kDeviceList

- Fix: Devicelist did not handle right, if device changed its address higher.

- Fix: PNG message handler order problem on tNMEA2000::AttachMsgHandler(tMsgHandler *_MsgHandler);

- Fix: If there was NMEA2000 library device with same name, they handshaked both addresses to null.
  The problem still appears, if both devices will be started at same time. I need to add some
  random start delay
  
- Cleaned spaces from end of lines on updated code.

29.11.2017

- Added PGN 128000 Leeway to N2kMessages.h/.cpp

- Fix: Spelling WaterRefereced -> WaterReferenced on N2kMessages.h/.cpp

27.11.2017

- Fix some build errors due to missing include statements (did not affect Arduino, only other platforms)

14.11.2017

- Fix: Default responces to Complex Group Function.

09.11.2017

- Added library.json, thanks for ronzeiller.

31.10.2017

- Fix: fill unused chars on fastpacket messages with 0xff

- Fix: fill unused chars on message fixed sized strings with 0xff. One sample is e.g. PGN 126996, Product Information.

14.10.2017

- Changed tActisenseReader class to handle also Actisense N2k request message types. This type will be used
  by applications, which sends data through NGT-1.
  
- Updated related examples ActisenseListener and ActisenseListenerSender.

- Renamed Min/Max to N2kMin/N2kMax, since Due code had definitions for Min/Max

12.10.2017

- Added PGN validity check to the SendMsg()

- Changed max/min -> own Max/Min. max/min defines does not exist on other systems and Arduino does not have std <Algorithm> for all boards.

10.10.2017

- Fix: PGN 126992 TimeSource handling.

- Fix: Added missing wind reference type.

02.10.2017

- Added range parameter for depth PGN 128267. 

- Added millis() time stamp to N2kMsg clear text Print.

- Now responces also Group Function request for PGN lists PGN 126464

- Now responces also Group Function request for Product Information PGN 126996

- Now responces also Group Function request for Configuration Information PGN 126998

- Fix: spelling Sertification -> Certification

- Fix: on changing SystemInstance reseted DeviceInstance

- Fix: "Group function" responces according to tests with certified Airmar DST800

- Fix: Address claiming could go up to 253 and did not went to "cannot claim". Now, if address cannot be claimed, goes to "cannot claim state" and prevents all message output except ISO address claim.

- Fix: fast packet response for less than 7 data bytes caused two frames.

26.09.2017

- Fixed PGN 128259 parser SOG data type. 

- DataDisplay2 example update.

31.08.2017

- Support for changing configuration information fields InstallationDescription1 and InstallationDescription2 on runtime e.g. with NMEA Reader.
Meaning of those fields is define their "installation description". So if you have two engine monitor devices, you can set e.g. InstallationDescription1 field to 
"Port engine" for one and "Starboard engine" for other. So it is not necessary to hardcode those setting. Of coarse your code must support
parameter saving to e.g. EEPROM as with other parameters (see ReadResetInstallationDescriptionChanged, ReadResetAddressChanged and ReadResetDeviceInformationChanged).
I have example under construction for handling parameter changes.

- Changed some indexes to size_t. This may effect compatibility, if you have used those functions.

31.07.2017

- New versions of NMEA2000_due and due_can (see. https://github.com/ttlappalainen/due_can)

29.07.2017

- Fixed setting device instances on N2kGroupFunctionDefaultHandlers

- Fixed wind PGN 130306 output with reserved field.

- New abstract class tNEMA2000:tMsgHandler and functions AttachMsgHandler/DetachMsgHandler. With these you can have multiple 
  handlers. It also allow PGN specific handlers. See how it has been used on example DeviceAnalyzer. Other simple example
  is under construction.
  
- New class tN2kDeviceList. See more on library reference and on example DeviceAnalyzer.

- Improved message type checking. This will be done for every message, so speed in important. For Arduino Mega average test time
  was dropped from about 90 us to 9 us and for Teensy from 3.5 us to 0.9 us.

26.06.2017 Example updates

- ActisenseListenerSender can be used to listen and send data to NMEA 2000 bus.
  This is almost same as TeensyActisenseListenerSender, but read and forward
  ports can be chosen with #define.

- ActisenseListener uses now SetN2kCANReceiveFrameBufSize.

- Removed FromPCToN2k. ActisenseListenerSender replaces this.

25.06.2017 Fix and cosmetic changes

- ForwardStream initialization was accidentaly deleted

- Clean code and more debug options.

22.06.2017 Fixes and cosmetic changes

- Crashed, if ForwardStream was not defined. I accidentaly forgot to comment
  some debug code.

- Definition of tDeviceInformation changed to fixed sized data so that compiler
  can not mix them.

- Added debug definitions to avoid first bug.

- Some cosmetic changes and tests.

19.06.2017 Changes due to different revisions of FlexCAN library for Teeansy
boards. NOTE! You must update NMEA2000_Teensy library.
I also forked and developed FlexCAN library from collin80 and also send pull
request for him. Until updated there my fork has more features for use with
NMEA2000 library.

13.06.2017 NOTE! Some compatibility changes.

- !NOTE compatibility change. `tProductInformation` has been moved inside
  `tNMEA2000` class. If you have defined `tProductInformation` to `PROGMEM` as
  in example `BatteryMonitor`, you need to change definition `const
  tProductInformation`... to `const tNMEA2000::tProductInformation`...  See
  example `BatteryMonitor`.

- Multi device support should work now. So you can show several devices on bus
  with single hw. See example MultiDevice.

- !NOTE compatibility change. tDeviceInformation has been moved inside
  tNMEA2000 class. This was used only internally until 11.06.2017 release.

11.06.2017 Added NMEA 2000 mandatory features. Some bug fixes.

- !NOTE compatibility change. PROGMEM configuration information did not work
  and actually wasted RAM.  You should define each configuration information
  string alone as PROGMEM and call changed SetProgmemConfigurationInformation.
  See sample BatteryMonitor

- Due to new mandatory features library requires more RAM and program memory.
  It is possible to squeeze requirements with compiler options. See more info
  on NMEA2000_CompilerDefns.h.

- Added new class tN2kGroupFunctionHandler (N2kGroupFunction.h/.cpp) for NMEA
  2000 group function (PGN 126208) handling.  Group function can be used to
  e.g. to set "temperature instance" or "set temperature" fields on PGN 130316.

- Added automatic Heartbeat, which is mandatory for certified NMEA 2000
  devices. If you do not want it to be sent, you have to set heartbeat interval
  to 0. Added also function SetHeartbeatInterval, GetHeartbeatInterval and
  SendHeartbeat.

- Added group function handling for PGN 60928 (ISO Address) and PGN 126993
  (Heartbeat). Handlers can be found on N2kGroupFunctionDefaultHandlers module.

- Added functions ReadResetDeviceInformationChanged,
  SetDeviceInformationInstances, GetDeviceInformation for checking, setting and
  reading device instance changes. See more info on document.

- Added ISO Multi-packet handling. Changed logic on SetN2kCANBufMsg due this.

05.06.2017

- Added PGN 130314 by sarfata.

- Added PGN 127245 rudder parser

- Fixed Device Information, last bit must be set to 1

- Fixed response to ISO Address Claim request. Seems that all new devices
  respond allways with broadcast instead of caller address.

28.05.2017

- Changed default NMEA2000 variable definition in NMEA2000_CAN.h to
reference. So now it is possible to refer it in other modules with definition:
extern tNMEA2000 &NMEA2000;

08.04.2017

- Added Binary status report (PGN 127501) handling. See updated
examples MessageSender and DataDisplay2.

09.03.2017

- Added PGN 129539 support and PGN 129283, 129284 parsers by
denravonska.

07.03.2017

- Debug mode check for DeviceReady and ParseMessages.

05.03.2017

- RPi socketCAN auto selection and MBED compiler portability fix by
thomasonw.

08.02.2017

- Fixed Heading PGN 127250 parsing

22.01.2017

- Replace pointer casting with memcpy to avoid unaligned access, and
add endian support. Thanks to denravonska.

- Handle for PGN 65240 "Commanded address". E.g. diagnostic device may command
  your device to change address.

01.01.2017

- Document and some example fixes to match library portability
changes.

20.12.2016

- Added support for PGN 126464L, PGN List (Transmit and Receive).
Library will automatically respond to this message.  You need only add message
lists and call to methods ExtendTransmitMessages and/or ExtendReceiveMessages.
See e.g. example TemperatureMonitor.

17.12.2016 

- Fixes to avoid compiler warnings

16.12.2016

- Portability fixes. Thanks to denravonska and thomasonw!

- NOTE! compatibility issue! There is no more default stream set on library
  constuctor. So in case you are using forwarding, you need to setup it (like
  in examples) NMEA2000.SetForwardStream(&Serial);

- This reduces the Arduino dependency, allowing the library to more easily be
  used on other platforms. Check all changes under
  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000/pull/35

01.12.2016

- License change to MIT for more permissive

- Also some started to remove platform dependent code.

12.11.2016

- PGN129025 parser added and some fixes by KimBP

11.11.2016

- Added support for PGN 127258 - magnetic variation by adwuk.

18.10.2016

- Added parsing for PGN 130311 by adwuk. Typo fix for system date
comment by sarfata.

19.09.2016

- Lot of testing behind - hopefully works now better.

- NOTE! New method SetN2kCANSendFrameBufSize. Added buffer for frames to be
  sent. This takes more RAM and may be critical for low RAM systems.

- If frame sending fails, system now buffers frames to be sent automatically
  and tries to resend them on next call for ParseMessages.  With this feature
  it solved my problem that time to time my MFD could not receive important
  GNSS or SOG/GOG messages and informed error.

- System now also has more reliable response to the Product Information ISO
  request (PGN 126998). Unfortunately if your system does not poll often enough
  incoming messages (ParseMessages), you still may loose the request itself.
  This is specially the case if you system spends some time reading sensors
  like 1-wire system. Even with 1-wire asynchronous read, it may spend 10 ms
  interrupts disabled. Within 10 ms there may be about 30 messages on bus.

- New methods SetConfigurationInformation and
  SetProgmemConfigurationInformation. System can now also handle Configuration
  Information ISO request to (PGN 126998). Default configuration information is
  saved to PROGMEM.

- NOTE! Reload also NMEA2000_due!

17.09.2016

- Temporary fix for problem to respond product information ISO
request.

12.09.2016

- Thanks for people (usauerbrey, OzOns), who noted below problems

- NOTE! If you are using NMEA2000_can, remember to update that too!

- Fix for ISORequest handling. Now responds allways also for broadcasts.

- Some fixes to avoid compiler warnings.

- Fix for parsing PGN 127257/Attitude

09.08.2016

- NOTE! Fixed PGN 130310, PGN 130311 and added
SetHandleOnlyKnownMessages(), which effects backward compatibility. See below.

- NOTE! On PGN 130310 and PGN 130311 description says that "Atmospheric
  pressure in Pascals. Use function mBarToPascal". There was scaling error and
  now they works like description. After update you have to provide value on
  Pascals and really use mBarToPascal, if you have your value in mBar.

- NOTE! Added SetHandleOnlyKnownMessages(). If you have called
  SetForwardOnlyKnownMessages(true), library did not handle unknown messages.
  After update, this effects only message forwarding - as it should have been.
  So call also SetHandleOnlyKnownMessages(true), if you want to disable any
  handling for unknown messages.

- NMEA 2000 Library reference update.

- Added ExtendSingleFrameMessages and ExtendFastPacketMessages. With these one
  can own list of known messages so that it is not necessary to duplicate
  message list as, if used only SetSingleFrameMessages and
  SetFastPacketMessages.

- Added discrete status flags for transmission parameters (PGN 127493), thanks
  for testing Jason.

06.08.2016

- Added SetISORqstHandler for setting handler for ISO requests. Thanks
thomasonw.

30.07.2016

- NMEA 2000 Library reference update.

- Added example TeensyActisenseListenerSender. Example contains code, schematics
and document.

19.07.2016

- Fixed discrete status on engine dynamic parameters (PGN 127489),
thanks Jason.

- Added new PGN 127257, vessel attitude. Only sending has been tested with NMEA
Reader

12.07.2016

- Added to API -- Optional message lists by thomasonw

25.06.2016

- Corrected Battery Current in ParseN2kPGN127508 by thomasonw.

23.03.2016

- Additional PGN 129038, PGN 129039, PGN 129285, PGN 130074 support by
adwuk.

13.03.2016

- Fix of using PROGMEM. Now also product information defined to
PROGMEM works right.

13.03.2016

- Fix of using PROGMEM. Still does not work right with product
information in PROGMEM. So all changes after 09.03 are still under validation.

13.03.2016

- More memory optimization - thanks for thomasonw. Constant message
strings has been marked with F(...) moving them to flash instead of RAM.

Note also that there is new function `void tNMEA2000::SetProductInformation(const tProductInformation *_ProductInformation);` So one can save memory by
defining product information to flash by using syntax: 

  const tProductInformation BatteryMonitorProductInformation PROGMEM={
  1300,               // N2kVersion
  ...

See example BatteryMonitor.ino

12.03.2016

- Memory tuning. Currently multi device and user definable message
filters has not been implemented, so I changed buffer sizes to minimum.

- There is also new function void tNMEA2000::SetN2kCANMsgBufSize(const unsigned
char _MaxN2kCANMsgs); to define buffer size for received N2k messages.  Note
that library has to collect fast packet frames, which may arrive fragmented
from different devices, so as default this buffer size has been set to 5.  If
your device is only sending some data (mode is tNMEA2000::N2km_NodeOnly), you
do not need to catch all fast packet messages (if any), so you can set buffer
size smaller.

09.03.2016

- Additional PGN 127250, PGN 128275 Support by adwuk.

08.03.2016

- AVR CAN support by thomasonw.

02.02.2016

- NOTE! Updates, which effects backward compatibility. See list below.

- PGN 127489, SetN2kPGN127489 EngineOilTemp and EngineCoolantTemp is in Kelvins
  as in other temperature functions. So add for call to this
  function CToKelvin(...)

- Some function names withing N2kMessages have been changed. Change function names listed below! +
    SetN2kPGNSystemTime -> SetN2kSystemTime +
    ParseN2kPGNSystemTime -> ParseN2kSystemTime +
    SetN2kPGNTrueHeading -> SetN2kTrueHeading +
    SetN2kPGNMagneticHeading -> SetN2kMagneticHeading

- Variable types has been changed on some functions in N2kMessages. So when you get an compiler error about functions in N2kMessages, check
  carefully all parameter definitions for function from N2kMessages.h.

- If you do not have value for some parameter for functions in N2kMessages, use related N2kxxxxNA constant defined in N2kMsg.h. So e.g. if you only have
  wind speed, call +
  SetN2kWindSpeed(N2kMsg, 1, ReadWindSpeed(),N2kDoubleNA,N2kWind_Apprent);

- If you are reading values from N2k bus, you can now check does some value exist by using function N2kIsNA.
  So if you e.g. call +
  ParseN2kOutsideEnvironmentalParameters(N2kMsg,SID,WaterTemperature,OutsideAmbientAirTemperature,AtmosphericPressure); +
  then check pressure value with +
  if ( !N2kIsNA(AtmosphericPressure) ) { // It is available, so we can show it!

- Added reference document to the documents, which hopefully helps to get started.

23.01.2016

- Added PGN 127493 support. NMEA2000_mcp has now interrupt support. Some other fixes.

23.01.2016

- Added some comments to samples and several new message readers. Also added support for 130316 extended temperature.
Added new include N2kMessagesEnumToStr.h for translating library enums to clear text. This is now just for preliminary
so I may changes texts in coming future.
Added also new examples DataDisplay2.ini and MessageSender.ino. They are extended versions of DataDisplay.ino and
TemperatureMonitor.ino.

05.12.2015

- Added NMEA2000_CAN.h and some fixes. Library has been originally developed with Arduino Software 1.6.5
On Arduino Software 1.6.6 it is possible to include libraries within included files, so now it is possible to just
include one file NMEA2000_CAN.h, which automatically selects right CAN library according. So you can have same code for
different hw. Currently supported CAN libraries are mcp_can, due_can and teensy.
Note! NMEA2000_CAN.h is now used on examples TemperatureMonitor and WindMonitor!

== Memory requirements ==

I have tried to measure memory used by library, but it is not so simple, since
there are some automated operations.  With version 11.06.2017 I got results:

- Approximate ROM 26.9 kB
- Approximate RAM  3.4 kB

This is with simple TemperatureMonitor example. This can be squeezed by
setting:

- Add below to setup() before NMEA2000.Open();
....
  NMEA2000.SetN2kCANMsgBufSize(2);
  NMEA2000.SetN2kCANSendFrameBufSize(15);
....

- Defining ProductInformation to PROGMEM as in BatteryMonitor example.

- Disabling all extra features. See NMEA2000_CompilerDefns.h

- Disable interrupt receiving.

With those setting you can go down to appr. 19 kB ROM and 1.9 kB RAM. So for 2
kB devices like Arduino Uno, there is not much for your own code.

== Hardware setup ==

NMEA2000 is inherited from CAN. Many MCUs like Teensy >3.1, ESP32, Arduino Due has already
CAN controller inside. If your MCU does not have CAN controller inside or you need second
external CAN controller, you can use e.g. MCP2515 CAN controller, which is supported by
library.

For final connection to the bus you need CAN bus_transceiver chip. Devices on NMEA2000
bus should be isolated to avoid ground loops. So if you take power from NMEA2000
bus and your device is not connected to ground enywhere else, you can use unisolated tranceiver
like MCP2551, MCP2562 or SN65HVD234.
If you instead feed power to your device directly or e.g. use engine own sensors for measuring,
you have to use isolated tranceivers like ISO1050. Remember also use isolated power supply, if you take power
from bus and have any unisolated connection to anywhere on your whole system. 

Easiest for connecting to NMEA2000 bus is to use some ready shield.

Note that there are several different shields for CAN bus available and others may use
8 MHz chrystal instead of default 16 MHz chrystal. This must be set before including NMEA2000_CAN.h

In case you build your tranceiver connection by yourself there are some connection examples

Library has been also used with Maple Mini board.

== Software setup ==

You need at least Arduino Software 1.6.6 for this sample. I'll expect you are
familiar with Arduino and using libraries. When your Arduino environment is
ready,

- Download https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000[NMEA2000] library zip.

- Depending of your board download libraries as zip:
** For Teensy 4.x - works also with 3.1/3.2/3.5/3.6, but is under tests.
***  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_Teensyx[NMEA2000_Teensyx]
***  Remember also install https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html[Teensyduino]!

** For Teensy 3.1/3.2/3.5/3.6
***  https://github.com/sarfata/NMEA2000_teensy[NMEA2000_teensy]
***  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/FlexCAN_Library[FlexCAN_Library]
***  Remember also install https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html[Teensyduino]!
     Note that on installing Teensyduino you should not install FleCAN with it.

** For ESP32

***  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/due_can[due_can]

** For external CAN bus controller MCP2515 like with Arduino Mega CAN shields
***  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_mcp
***  https://github.com/ttlappalainen/CAN_BUS_Shield[mcp_can]

- Install all libraries to your Arduino IDE (Sketch-Include Library-Add .ZIP library).

- Open `NMEA2000\Examples\TemperatureMonitor`.

- Connect you board to USB and NMEA2000 bus.

- Send sketch to your board.

- If you have Multi Function Display (e.g. Garmin GMI-20) on your NMEA2000 bus,
  you should see on it's NMEA2000 bus devices new device "Simple temp monitor"
  on the list.

Now you are ready to play with your own device. Check also the
`NMEA2000\Examples\ActisenseListener`, which reads all data from NMEA2000 bus and
sends it to PC. `NMEA2000/Examples/ArduinoGateway` allows you to mimic Actisense
NGT-1 and connect e.g. a Raspberry Pi running Signal-K to the NMEA2000 bus with
an Arduino or Teensy.

== Forcing CAN "driver" (was using Arduino Software older than 1.6.6) ==

In examples there are simple includes: +
#include <Arduino.h> +
#include <NMEA2000_CAN.h>  // This will automatically choose right CAN library and create suitable NMEA2000 object +

If that can not be used (like with Arduino IDE older than 1.6.6) or you would like to control naming and used "driver",
you can manually include necessary files. Specially if you want to use secondary CAN bus on your system.
